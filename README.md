# MeanStack-Simple-Setup

Hello World this is a simple mean stack setup that I've put to together to hopefully save you some time and frustration.

To get started make sure you have npm, bower, gulp, mongo, installed globally.

Once they are installed run these commands.

$ npm install 'This will install your package.json dependencies'

$ bower install 'This will install your bower.json dependencies'

next run 

$ mongod 'this will start the mongo server'

$ mongo 'this will open your mongo database and it will connect to your mongod server'

$ gulp 'this will start your express server and open your browser if it doesnt load right away just refresh the page you should see Welcome to MeanStack Simple Setup'.
